We ask you to write a protocol (subject of your choice) and push it to your **"metadata folder"** following the requested guideline:
 
#### 1. The protocol must be written in a text editor of your choice between *Markdown*, *Atom* or *Visual Studio*.

#### 2. _Within this protocol you will need to have the following points (a-f):_ 

**(a)** Organize titles in different font size

**(b)** Use **bold**, *italic* and _underline_ in the protocol
 
**(c)** Insert photos with captions  
For example:

Figure 1: *Pocillopora grandis* in the reef of Moorea.  

**(d)** Insert tables (screenshots not allowed) that include 6 columns, 6 raws and a title to each columnn
